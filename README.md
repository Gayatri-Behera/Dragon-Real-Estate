Boston Housing Analysis for Investment Decisions,
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Boston’s housing market to provide data-driven insights for investors. Utilized various statistical and machine learning techniques to identify profitable investment opportunities, predict property prices, and assess the potential return on investment based on factors like location, property features, and market trends.

• Data Collection & Transformation: Processed unstructured data into CSV format for analysis using Excel.
• Data Wrangling: Cleaned datasets by managing null values and duplicates.
• Data Analysis & Visualization: Analyzed correlations and visualized results using scatter plots, bar charts, tree
plots, histograms and linear graphs with Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn).
• Model Evaluation: Split datasets into training and testing sets, assessing accuracy and precision to refine model
performance.
• Predictive Modeling: Trained models and fine-tuned parameters to improve performance metrics (e.g., accuracy,
recall).
• Cross-Validation: Performed predictive analysis on test data, evaluated cross-validation scores, and addressed
overfitting.
• Housing Price Prediction: Developed a regression model to forecast housing prices, using feature engineering,
and evaluating performance through MAE and RMSE.
